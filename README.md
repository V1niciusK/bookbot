# bookbot
This is definitelly not my first project, but for the sakes of the course I will state so.
"
BookBot is my first project!
"
### Description
Bookbot is a simple python script that will parse the contents of a text file and print statistics related to said file, like line and word count as well as character occurance.
It was built and tested using Python 3.10.12

### How to use this script
I wouldn't recomend using this script for large files (Gigabytes long) as it is poorly optimized on top of being written in python, a notoriously not well optimized language to boot.

But if you want to use it anyway, here are the steps:
1. Download the python script
1. Inside the script, change the second line with the path of the text file (the path must be relative to the script's current location)
1. Run the script
